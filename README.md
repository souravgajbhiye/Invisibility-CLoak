# Invisibility-CLoak
Being a harry potter fan I always had a childhood fantasy of using an invisibility cloak. Well it turns out that using simple image processing tricks I can now actually fulfill my childhood fantasy. This code turns a red color cloth into an invisibility cloak. That's my little brother trying it out and having fun.
